# Exonic repeat finder
For Bioinformatics Programming Challenges, 2021

## Description
This program searches a given sequence into the exons of one (or various) genes.

## Results
From the original 168-genes list, this program found that 49 did not have the cttctt repeat in their exons. The ids of these genes is contained in `files/no_repeat_genes.txt`.

Here, the AT2G46340 gene is showed with the positions of the cttctt repeats that were found (named as kebab_repeat). This image was obtained in the [ENSEMBL plant genome browser.](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/index.html)
